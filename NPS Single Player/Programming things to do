>change up the random generation so that there arent so many lumps, but there are nice hills :D

>make the collision work

unique login name, the server will create a new account file, etc.

>make the game so when you first download it, you only download the login client, because i want the
login client to actually update the updater if needed, then start it. when you first start the login

the server needs to get a list of EVERYTHING in the AVTECH folder, digitalize it, and send it using
the pre-existing updateobject in the server... (currently, the updater is run first, then it starts the
main jar, which holds the login frame as well)
