list of things to do :D

>change up the random generation so that there arent so many lumps, but there are nice hills :D
(thought: make the game generate chunks, like blocks of 6x6, and the chunks are random, so like 1 chunk
would be a hill, another would be a cave pit, etc...)

>make the collision work

>change how the game updates, so that it will know what files to download, instead of individual...

>test the update stuff, then make the "nps starter" unzip the files and move them
