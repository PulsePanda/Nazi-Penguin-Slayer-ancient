list of things to do :D

>fix the lag created when a nice background is implemented
	possible fixes: make file size smaller
	figure out why only loading the image 1 time makes the player disappear
	make everything scale, so that i can make the game in a 20x20 window, and then have it all scale
		up to reduce lag
	try a buffer strategy? (no idea how...)

>fix jumping thing (otherwise take out jumping, and have the player auto move upward

>add weapons

>add bases

>read green comment in Player/jump()/for loop

>test to make sure the setting of the most recent update works, in the starter jar under Connection/Update. its labeled with blue comments
